create Repo on Github.com
open terminal
change to the directory you want to push
type: "git init" to initialize the folder
type: "git add ." to add all files inside the folder
type: "git status" to see changes that can be commited
type: "git commit -m "comment"

now you have to configure your email and username with

now copy the link of your repo
and type: "git remote add origin https://github.com/bjt-user/HowToUseGit.git"

git push -u origin master

=> this worked, now how can I update the folder?

by typing "git add .", then optionally "git status", "git commit -m "comment"", and then "git push -u origin master"

now leave out the "origin master" on the push
=> and that also works, so you just need "git push -u"
